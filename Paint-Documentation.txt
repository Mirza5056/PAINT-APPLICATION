***********************************************************************************************

This is simple paint application made in java through graphical user interface
in this application You can draw anything on canvas like draw rectangle, square ,line 
And with the help of eraser you can erase them which you have draw on canvas 

First have class MyDrawingPad in which i have been set background color and foreground color 
which the help of foreground color we can easily remove drawing which we have have draw previsouly
this all have return in MyDrawingPad contructor 

After that we want to store all circle rectangle and drawline shapes which we can store in ArrayList
Now i Have assign value means in circleStartingPoint and circleEndPoint in that area we can easily draw circle
Like that i take for Rectangle also as same 

Now with the help of mousePressed java class we set circleStartingPoint and circleEndPoint with the help
of MouseEvent we can getX() and getY() 

Now with the help of mouseRealesed take variable radius we can draw circle
Like that only Now in case of rectangle we take two variable width and height
after that in mousePressed we getX() and getY() we will substract rectangleStartingPoint and 
rectangleEndPoint 

Now using mouseDragged Method now using drawOval and pass circleStartingPoint and circleEndPoint
So easily we cann draw circle and like that only we can do with rectangle drawRect in case of we have to 
pass width and height to draw it 

Now we have to store all shapes in ArrayList so we can save them to do that we make three class circle
and rectangle and drawline in drawline case we can take List<Point> points and through for loop
help we can take all points like which it have starts to draw until the points.size() we wll do i++
through g.drawline( we can store it x and y poitns)

Like this in circle case but in circle we will use drawOval to draw and  Rectangle case use drawRect

If user want to remove drawing we will take flag variable isEraserActive is in we set its property 
to foreground and set g.setColor(isEraserActive ? getBackground() : firstColor) with the help of this 
it get background and For more information you can see myCode for better understanding


Now make class Drawing which we will extends JFrame 
First make MyDrawingPad object 
Now make buttons like pencil and so on put all things in JPanel
Like that only make some color buttons put them also in JPanel use images java colors to  set buttons color
                        Example button.setColor(Color.RED);

After that implement actionListener now which you have made object of MyDrawingPad 
Now class MyDrawingPad we make setFirstColor and getFirstColor with the help of that
now pd.setFirstColor(Color.RED) for red button and like that for different button
now add All things in container and adjust its size according to your respectivley

Now if user take near the button than it show the name for this use ButtonToolTipMouseListener which will extends MouseAdapter
                        Example pencilButton.addMouseListener(new ButtonTooltipMouseListener("pencil"));


For setting eraser button usse pd.setEraser(); in actionListener
for using colorGrading in which user  can adjust its color according to it use JColorChooser

Main important for anny application to save it i am using JFileChooser
we will take BufferedImage to getWidth and getHeight and use Graphics2D to create imgeGraphics
now using Graphics2D setBackgroundColor and Now we store all circle and rectangle in ArrayList get 
it through loop and using Graphics2D draw( all the shapes )

After give JOptionPane if use print drawingSaved
If not than print not saved
